Building HTML

first the game is going to need a button with the roll function 
i also want to have a sound play as the roll button is clicked.

you will also need a <p> to say player one and a box that will update the score. 

background you can use a photo from google. 


building javascript 

you will need to build a function that will randomly generate numbers between 1-6 DONE

you also need to find a way to cap the amount of dice rolls a player can make to 6 

also you need to find a way for the player to win the game if they get over 20

if the player rolls a 1 then you need to find a way for the game to restart.
